年轻的时候，我认为我肯定能成为伟大的艺术家，但我现在并不是。我有我的局限性。但是你知道，即便你自身有局限性，只要你尽了全力，只要你不出卖自己，不被不值得的东西收买，你仍然可以过上美好的生活。你不必一生都鞭挞自己，你又不是达芬奇，我也不是。——伍迪·艾伦

When you are old and grey and full of sleep,  
And nodding by the fire, take down this book,  
And slowly read, and dream of the soft look  
Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;  
How many loved your moments of glad grace,  
And loved your beauty with love false or true,  
But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,  
And loved the sorrows of your changing face;  
And bending down beside the glowing bars,  
Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled  
And paced upon the mountains overhead  
And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.

当你老了，头发白了，睡意昏沉&#8230;
